# FunctionAgents
Call Function from LLM


Hello John -- I worked on this for 6+ hours and couldn't quite get it to be perfectly functional. I think the prompt engineering is quite difficult - for some reason it's not extracting the parametesr that well by interpreting the user's input. 

new_server.js is currently succesful in

(1) Interpreting that an existing function can be used, and executing this. 
- adding numbers
- greeting user (regardless of the user input: eg. user can say "Greet Bella" or "say hello to Bella" and it knows to use this function)

(2) Creating a new function if an existing function does not work 
- test: multiply 2 and 3 
- test: divide 2 and 3


Fails in
- add 2 and 3 and 4. I think the issue is that the parameter extracting AI assistant is not matching the extracted parameters with the function.
